This wasn't really written for public use initially.  But since so many have asked how I was doing things like 
the online Heatmaps via Google Maps, I figured I'd post the code so others could at least browse through some
of it.  

I hope it's useful.

I'm willing to try to work on issues that occur when time permits at least for the near term. 

This stuff REALLY isn't production ready code.  

ONE THING YOU'LL FOR CERTAIN NEED TO DO is to EDIT: classes/config.php this is where I think most of the paths
and definitions of hardware used by the system are defined.

I use two systems in my setup that share a NFS drive.  One controls the RTL's and other controls things like 
the Web GUI and GPS, NFS, and things like that.

THIS IS NOT PLUG AND PLAY.  I can help you to a point, but I'm not your private IT team.  If you can't code in
PHP, HTML, Javascript that's on you - sorry.
